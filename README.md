# HW4: Linting and Testing

This homework involves revisions to the files you created in HW 3.

(2 points) Change test_create_dataframe.py to be runnable as a test file (using pytest if you prefer).

(5 points) Make create_dataframe and test_create_dataframe PEP8 compliant. You should get a score of at least 9 out of 10. Please put your pylint output in your repo.
